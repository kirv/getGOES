NAME
    DataSite/GOES -- thinobject class representing a GOES data platform

DESCRIPTION
    The GOES NOAA DCS platform ID is stored in the object, and used to
    retrieve data from a network-connected server.  Results are stored
    in the object and accessed by various methods.

    Initially, queries will be run periodically and stored, but will
    not be parsed or interpreted.  Later, data will be fully processed
    and made available from this system, and probably also pushed up to
    other database systems.

METHODS
    init -- create log, query, and other contained objects
    query-dcp-server -- get data for the platform
    help   -- display this help screen

PROPERTIES
    %config -- settings file
    @results -- output from last query
    @alldata -- append query-log message and @results from each query

ATTRIBUTES
