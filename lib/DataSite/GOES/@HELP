NAME
    DataSite/GOES -- thinobject class to manage data from a GOES-DCP platform

DESCRIPTION
    The GOES NOAA DCS platform ID is stored in the object, and used to
    retrieve data from a network-connected server.  Results are stored
    in the object and accessed by various methods.

METHODS
    query-server -- get data for the platform
    parse-dcp-message -- parse and optionally store dcp message
    parse-good-data -- virtual method to process received data
    ingest -- call the above three methods in turn 
    validate-dcpid -- utility to check @DCPID for 8 hexadecimal characters
    init -- initialize the object when created

OBJECTS
    ingest (Object)             -- container for ingest-related items
    ingest/log (TimeSeries)     -- log results of ingest query
    dcp-msg (Aggregate)         -- container for dcp messages:
    dcp-msg/good (TimeSeries)   -- known-good messages
    dcp-msg/parity (TimeSeries) -- messages with parity errors
    dcp-msg/missed (TimeSeries) -- no data was collected from remote DCP
    dcp-msg/failed (TimeSeries) -- other failures
    data-raw (Aggregate)        -- container for platform data fields
    data (Aggregate)            -- container for normalized data fields

PROPERTIES
    @DCPID                      -- unique DCP identifier
    @NAME                       -- descriptive name for the site
    ingest/@raw                 -- unparsed, raw output from last query
    ingest/@{yy}-{mm}-alldata   -- accumulate raw query results
    @DCP-MESSAGE-FORMAT         -- reference documentation
    @DCP-header-description     -- more reference documentation
    @HELP                       -- this manpage
    @MENU, %MENU                -- command line menu entries
