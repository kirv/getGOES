16.11 GOES Downlink Message Header Basics

At times a user must look at the raw data sent from the satellite to see
if things are working properly. The first part of the message is very
important to understand as it may help identify problems at a site. Below
is an actual message sent from a site.

    163708DE08078184903G51+1NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

Now lets break this down to understand it better.

The first 8 characters are the site ID or DPC address. They are shown
in bold below.

    _163708DE_08078184903G51+1NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next two bytes are the year. In this case the 08 is for 2008.

    163708DE_08_078184903G51+1NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next 3 bytes are the julian day. In this case 078 and is March 18th,
on a leap year..

    163708DE08_078_184903G51+1NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next 6 bytes is the time the transmission was received. This should
be within the assigned time window. In this transmission it was at 18
hours, 49 minutes and 03 seconds.

    163708DE08078_184903_G51+1NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next byte indicates if the transmission was received properly, the
"G' indicates `Good'.  Other possibilities are `P' for parity errors and
`?' for unknown errors.

    163708DE08078184903_G_51+1NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

the next two bytes show the signal strength of the signal received at
the satellite. In this case it is 51 which is real good. Numbers in
the high forties is good, lower forties is fair and if at 35 or less,
it is surprising the transmission is making it to the satellite.

    163708DE08078184903G_51_+1NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next two bytes indicate if there is any frequency drift. A plus 0
is ideal indicating no drift.  In this case the +1 indicates a positive
drift of 50 Hz from the center frequency. For each count, 1, 2, 3 etc
it refers to 50 Hz per count of drift. A drift of 1 or 2 positive or
negative is common.

    163708DE08078184903G51_+1_NN021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next two bytes indicate modulation status. The NN indicates normal
modulation index, and normal modulation quality. The index may also
report an `H' or `L' for high or low modulation index. The quality may
also report `F' or `P' for fair or poor quality.

    163708DE08078184903G51+1_NN_021EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next three bytes are the channel number. In this case 021 is channel
21. This is an odd number which normally indicates it is transmitting
to the eastern satellite, (75 Degrees W). Even channel numbers normally
transmit to the western satellite, (135 Degrees W).

    163708DE08078184903G51+1NN_021_EUB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next byte is a letter `E' or `W' indicating the eastern or western
satellite. In this case the eastern satellite.

    163708DE08078184903G51+1NN021_E_UB00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next two bytes are TBD.

    163708DE08078184903G51+1NN021E_UB_00023BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

The next few bytes indicate how many data bytes are going to be
transmitted. In this case 00023 data bytes.

    163708DE08078184903G51+1NN021EUB_00023_BCT@DZ@DY@Dc@Db@Dm@Dxj

This is the end of the header information added by the GOES
system. Everything from this point on is from the data logger and is
normally data. The data could be decoded using the discussion in section
16.7 above.

Also in this case it is easy to see this is a 100 baud transmission. This
is possible to see because the data starts immediately after the data
byte count. A 300 or 1200 baud transmission will have one extra byte in
the header information. This extra byte is after the byte count and the
start of data. This extra byte will always be one of four possibilities
and indicates the type of data and if the unit successfully updated its
time from a GPS system since the last transmission. The possibilities
are listed below.

    Character       Comment
    Space           ASCII Data, No time sync since the last transmission
    Double quote "  ASCII Data, Time did sync since the last transmission
    Single Quote `  Binary Data, No time sync since the last transmission
    Lower Case b    Binary Data, Time did sync since the last transmission

The following is a 300 baud transmission that shows binary data and that
the unit did sync since the last transmission, notice the lower case
`b' after the byte count..
