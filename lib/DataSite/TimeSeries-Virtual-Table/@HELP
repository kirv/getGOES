NAME
    DataSite/TimeSeries-Virtual-Table

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an ad hoc 'view' engine to work with timeseries column
    data.  The parent class is Aggregate, and component column objects will
    be processed in default order or as set in the .@order property.

METHODS
    get -- overloads TimeSeries.get, calling it as:

            object.super.get "$@"

        so that all arguments are passed to TimeSeries.get.  This allows 
        any form of TimeSeries.get queries to be used, but the code assumes
        that an ISO 8601 timestamp is output.  The timestamp is used as the
        key to join each record.

        The results are prsented in comma-separated form, with a leading
        header line.

        
    init -- initialize the object with symlinks to argument objects, in order
