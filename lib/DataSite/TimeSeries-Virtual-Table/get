# DataSite/TimeSeries-Virtual-Table.get-table runs in the context of an Aggregate object, and
# causes the TimeSeries.get method to be called with the same arguments on each contained object
# turn.  The results are as shown below, lists of column data, then this method recombines those
# results into records where the timestamps match.

# run TimeSeries.get query with given arguments, pipe to perl program
# results are expected to be applied to one or more column objects, so
# should have the form:
#   
#       Stage1.get last 4
#       2010-05-10 10:00:00-0800        2.50
#       2010-05-10 10:30:00-0800        2.47
#       ...
#   
#       stage2.get last 4
#       2010-05-10 10:00:00-0800        2.99
#       2010-05-10 10:30:00-0800        2.99
#       ...
# 
# But the timestamp can be anything if set by the --ots FORMAT option...
#
# NOTE: timestamp is assumed to be tab-terminated.

# calling TimeSeries.get via the Aggregate.do method:
