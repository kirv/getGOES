getGOES - manages data aquired from the NOAA GOES satellite system

getGOES is implemented in the thinobject system, using ordinary
directories, files, and executable programs. In fact, it is the first
application implemented from scratch in the thinobject system.

A thinobject class, DataSite/GOES, is defined and provides several methods
to operate on and access each object. Several properties are defined in
the object for storing settings, data, history, etc.

Example: create a site on the command line, query for data, output the
data received:


    $ tob-new fishck DataSite/GOES
    $ tob fishck.initialize dcpid 00000000
    $ tob fishck.query-dcp-server
    $ tob fishck.cat @results


The DataSite/GOES class is a directory in a defined thinobject library location. It can be accessed through a symlink in the object, e.g.:

    $ tob fishck.ls -l .^/
    total 16
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 ken staff 25 2009-11-04 16:15 ^ # /usr/local/lib/tob/Object
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 1048 2009-11-04 14:29 help
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 525 2009-11-04 16:29 initialize
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 1072 2009-11-04 16:40 query-dcp-server
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 473 2009-11-04 15:27 validate-dcpid

Each executable in the class directory can be run using the tob "enabler" program in the form:

    OBJECT.METHOD ARGUMENTS

E.g.,

    $ tob fishck.validate-dcpid badcode3
    non-hexadecimal character 3 in dcpid value: badcode3

The DataSite/GOES class directory itself contains a symlink to another class. The class hierarchy can be seen using the type method (one of a few built-in methods), e.g.:

    $ tob fishck.type
    DataSite/GOES:Object:Directory

Executables from any linked class can be run as object methods. All available methods can be seen using the method method:

    $ tob fishck.method | column
    help manual grep
    initialize notes ls
    query-dcp-server param method
    validate-dcpid scan-arguments mkdir
    _default set mv
    _default-dict show rm
    _default-dict-list usage rmdir
    _dictionary xhtml show-envars
    exists cat stat
    get-prop echo touch
    SUPER::help edit wc
    html find
