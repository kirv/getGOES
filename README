getGOES - manages data aquired from the NOAA GOES satellite system

getGOES is implemented in the thinobject system, using ordinary
directories, files, and executable programs. In fact, it is the first
application implemented from scratch in the thinobject system.

A thinobject class, DataSite/GOES, is defined and provides several methods
to operate on and access each object. Several properties are defined in
the object for storing settings, data, history, etc.

Example: create a site on the command line, query for data, output the
data received:

    $ tob-new fishck DataSite/GOES
    $ tob fishck.initialize dcpid 326AF6FE
    $ tob fishck.query-dcp-server
    $ tob fishck.cat @results

The DataSite/GOES class is a directory in a defined thinobject library
location. It can be accessed through a symlink in the object, e.g.:

    $ tob fishck.ls -l .^/
    total 16
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 ken staff 25 2009-11-04 16:15 ^ # /usr/local/lib/tob/Object
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 1048 2009-11-04 14:29 help
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 525 2009-11-04 16:29 initialize
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 1072 2009-11-04 16:40 query-dcp-server
    -rwxrw-r-x 1 ken staff 473 2009-11-04 15:27 validate-dcpid

Each executable in the class directory can be run using the tob "enabler"
program in the form:

    OBJECT.METHOD ARGUMENTS

E.g.,

    $ tob fishck.validate-dcpid badcode3
    non-hexadecimal character 3 in dcpid value: badcode3

The DataSite/GOES class directory itself contains a symlink to another
class. The class hierarchy can be seen using the type method (one of a
few built-in methods in tob), e.g.:

    $ tob fishck.type
    DataSite/GOES:Object:Directory

Executables from any linked class can be run as object methods. All
available methods can be seen using the method method:

    $ tob fishck.method | column
    help                    manual                  grep
    initialize              notes                   ls
    query-dcp-server        param                   method
    validate-dcpid          scan-arguments          mkdir
    _default                set                     mv
    _default-dict           show                    rm
    _default-dict-list      usage                   rmdir
    _dictionary             xhtml                   show-envars
    exists                  cat                     stat
    get-prop                echo                    touch
    SUPER::help             edit                    wc
    html                    find

The tob program resolves the object and cd's into it before the method
is invoked.  The contents of the object can be seen using ls:

    $ tob fishck.ls -l
    total 32
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ken site 13856 2009-11-04 21:53 @alldata
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ken site    24 2009-11-04 16:29 %config
    drwxrwSr-x 2 ken site  4096 2009-11-04 21:53 log
    drwxrwSr-x 2 ken site  4096 2009-11-04 16:08 query
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ken site   229 2009-11-04 21:53 @results

The query results and a flat file accumulating all data are prefixed
with the @ character in order to be treated as lists or arrays, e.g.,

    $ tob fishck.results            
    EDDN Field Retrieval
    
    DCP: 326AF6FE From now minus 1 hours until now.
    
    326AF6FE09309074903G50+1NN038WXW00124
    
    hg 16.22 16.22 16.22 16.22
    
    tw -0.0
    
    h2 17.31 17.31 17.32 17.31
    
    t2 -2.3
    
    ta -11.1
    
    pc 6.87
    
    us 24.7
    
    ud 64
    
    VB 12.9

or,
    $ tob fishck.results 3,5,7  
    DCP: 326AF6FE From now minus 1 hours until now.
    326AF6FE09309074903G50+1NN038WXW00124
    hg 16.22 16.22 16.22 16.22


The config file is prefixed with the % character in order to be treated
as a "dictionary" or "tag = value" file.

    $ tob fishck.config
    dcpid = 326AF6FE
    name = Fish Creek

or,
    $ tob fishck.config dcpid
    dcpid = 326AF6FE

The log and query directories are actually other objects, with their 
own properties and methods.

    $ tob fishck.log.type
    TimeSeries:Object:Directory

A crontab entry to run a query could be:

    $  crontab -l | grep GOES
    53 * * * * /usr/local/bin/tob /home/site/GOES/fishck.query-dcp-server
